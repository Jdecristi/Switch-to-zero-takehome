# Switch to Zero carbon foot print calculator

This project shows what it would look like for users to calculate their current carbon footprint and plan they should use to reach carbon neutrality.

## To get started

// Intentionally left blank until finished with installation and running instructions

## Design of the App

#### The apps with a frontend server and a backend server

The "root directory" serves only as the launch point in the app starting both servers in a single command

**Note:**
_I would not this "root directory" in a production environment. Ideally we would serve our frontend entirely from a CDN and interact with the backend via API's_
